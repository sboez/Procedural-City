Procedural city made with [this tuto](http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2013/08/02/how-to-do-a-procedural-city-in-100lines/). The render is different each time due to random variation. 

## Challenge 

For this project I started to work with [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) for the first time. Update myself with le last ThreeJS's version and produce something I've never done before. Also, I tried to add my project to gh-pages but I ddidn't still find the solution 

## Usage 

Install dependencies :
```
npm i
```

Start server :
```
npm run start
```
