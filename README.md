Procedural city made with [this tuto](http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2013/08/02/how-to-do-a-procedural-city-in-100lines/). The render is different each time due to random variation. 

For this project I started to work with [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) for the first time.

## Usage 

Install dependencies :
```
npm i
```

Start server :
```
npm run start
```
